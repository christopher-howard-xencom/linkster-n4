# linkster-n4
A utility automating many-to-many links in Niagara N4

## Backwards Compatibility Note
This module is built with the following version of N4
  Niagara N4 4.2.36.4 (Pre release)

Although it is built and version'ed for this build, it has no version dependency
and SHOULD be able to work all the way back to 4.0.  However, only official testing
has been done back to 4.2.

Note that this only automates value links, it does not know how to work
with the relation links.
